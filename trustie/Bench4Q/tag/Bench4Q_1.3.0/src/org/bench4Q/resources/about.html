<h1>The Bench4Q</h1>
<strong>A QoS Oriented B2C Benchmark</strong>

<p>E-commerce£¬as a very popular business model, has grown substantially with the development of Internet technology. In the meantime, the QoS of e-commerce, critical to the success of e-commerce systems, is a major factor in the success of competition. While the infrastructures of an e-commerce system, such as application server, play an important role in QoS guarantees, how to evaluate the performance of these infrastructure techniques has become the focus of the issue£®</p>
<p>Benchmark as a typical and impartial way to evaluate the e-commerce system is a key matter of people¡¯s concerns. However, the current e-commerce benchmarks that mainly concerning on transaction is lack of cares about customer¡¯s behavior. And they are lack of ability to measure the e-commerce¡¯s characteristic. Therefore, the current e-commerce Benchmark isn¡¯t an effective way to evaluate QoS guarantees of an e-commerce system.</p>
<p>By investigating the current e-commerce Benchmark, we find out the insufficient of them in measuring QoS guarantees. Then we introduce a new methodology for QoS oriented e-commerce benchmarking, named Bench4Q. Bench4Q has features to deduce a controllable and flexible representation of complex session-based workloads, and to simulate authentic customer behavior. What¡¯s more, we show that Bench4Q that mainly concerns on session, profit and QoS guarantee can provides an overall view of the system¡¯s performance.</p>
